# Steam Global Download Infrastructure Analysis

This repository contains the code, data, and report for the **final project** of  
**INFSCI 2415 – Information Visualization (Section 1010)**.

The project analyzes global patterns in Steam’s download infrastructure, focusing on:
- geographic distribution of download activity,
- cross-country differences in download speed, and
- temporal bandwidth usage across global regions.

All figures in the report were generated entirely in Python.

## Data Sources

- **City-level population and geographic coordinates**  
  Natural Earth + World Cities Database

- **Country-level Steam download traffic and average download speed**  
  Steam public statistics

- **Regional bandwidth usage time series (48 hours)**  
  Steam CDN aggregated monitoring data

All datasets were processed and matched using ISO3 country codes.

## Methods Overview

Country-level download traffic was allocated to cities proportionally by population.  
Download activity was log-transformed and visualized using a population-weighted point cloud.  
Download speed was visualized using a choropleth map.  
Temporal bandwidth usage was visualized using stacked area charts by global region.

Full implementation details are available in the Python scripts.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the main figure:

```bash
python code/Download_Activity.py      # Generates global download activity map
python code/Download_Speed.py         # Generates country-level download speed choropleth
python code/Download_Bandwidth.py     # Generates regional bandwidth time-series chart

```
The script generates the integrated figure in the figures/ .
